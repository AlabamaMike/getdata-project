## Input Files
Data was processed from testing and training dataset generated by subjects wearing a Samsung smartphone while performing numerous activities.  Descriptions of this data set can be found here:

## Variables
The observations can be grouped into two families of variables:  those sampled in a time-series, and observations that have been shifted into a frequency domain by use of a Fourier transform.  For each observation, the subject and his/her position are captured.  The columns for each observation are as follows:
Subject, Activity, Measurement[...]
Subject and Activity are both identifiers.  The Activity enumeration is as follows:
1 -> WALKING
2 -> WALKING_UPSTAIRS
3 -> WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS
4 -> SITTING
5 -> STANDING
6 -> LAYING
Measurement is a sequence of variables that represent the mean and standard deviations from the accelerometer data generated by the study.
